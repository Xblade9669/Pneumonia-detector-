# Pneumonia-detector-
Built an AI model, along with a team of 4 other classmates  that can predict if a person is having pneumonia or not by analysing lung X-rays and estimating the severity of the problem and assist the doctor accordingly,  in order to mitigate the problem. It uses application of deep learning and  predefined neural networks.
